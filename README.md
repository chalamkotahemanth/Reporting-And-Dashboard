SmartBank – Reporting and Dashboarding Module
📘 Project Overview
This module is developed as part of the SmartBank Modular Banking Backend System.
The use case focuses on Reporting and Dashboarding, which allows customers and banking administrators to view account summaries, transaction insights, and financial trends through APIs and optional dashboards.
The objective is to deliver a secure, modular, and scalable backend solution that provides meaningful reports and visualizations for banking data.

🎯 Problem Statement

The challenge was to design and implement a Reporting and Dashboard module that:
**Fetches and summarizes account and transaction data.**
Displays transaction patterns or trends.
Supports visual dashboard reporting for better understanding.
Can later be extended for fraud detection or loan analysis.
This use case helps customers track their account activity and allows banking admins to monitor financial trends and risk indicators.

🧩 Sprint Summary (Implementation Plan)

**Goal:**
To implement the Reporting and Dashboard use case from backend to basic visualization.

Key Activities Completed:
Understood and analyzed the reporting workflow.
Designed database structure for accounts and transactions.
Implemented REST APIs to fetch summaries and trends.
Tested the APIs through Swagger UI.
Built an optional dashboard using Streamlit for visualization.

**Documented the workflow and outcomes.**

**Flow Explanation:**

Customer/Admin requests a report via API or dashboard.
Backend aggregates data from accounts and transactions tables.
Processed summary is returned in JSON format or visualized in the dashboard.


📊** Data & Reporting Features**

**Account Summary:**
Displays total balance and transaction count for a given customer.

**Transaction Trends:**
Shows aggregated transaction amounts month-wise or week-wise to visualize spending and deposits.

**Dashboard View (Optional):**

Displays total balance and transaction statistics.
Visualizes trends using line or bar charts.
Helps customers identify unusual activity patterns.

🔗 **API Endpoints **
Endpoint	Method	Description
/report/account-summary/{customer_id}	GET	Returns balance and total transactions
/report/transaction-trends/{customer_id}	GET	Returns transaction summary grouped by month

🧪** Testing and Validation**
Test Area	Result
API Endpoint Accessibility	✅ APIs accessible via Swagger UI
Data Aggregation	✅ Correct totals and monthly grouping verified
Dashboard Functionality	✅ Successfully fetches and displays API data
Error Handling	✅ Returns clear messages for invalid customer IDs

**This project is deployed on Render.com
 using serverless deployment. Render automatically scales the application based on demand, so no server management is required.

Testing was performed through Swagger UI and manual database verification to ensure accuracy of reports.

📈 Expected Output

Account Summary Example:

{
  "customer_id": 1,
  "total_balance": 45000,
  "total_transactions": 37
}


Transaction Trend Example:

{
  "customer_id": 1,
  "trends": [
    {"month": "2025-01", "total": 12000},
    
    {"month": "2025-02", "total": 18000},
    {"month": "2025-03", "total": 15000}
  ]
}

🚀 Execution Instructions

Start the FastAPI backend using uvicorn.

Access Swagger UI at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs


(Optional) Run the Streamlit dashboard for visual reports.

Enter a valid customer_id to view the report.

🔒 **Security and Scalability Notes**

The APIs are modular and can integrate with authentication modules later.

Database design supports multiple accounts per customer.

Easily extendable for fraud analytics, loan reports, or admin summaries.

📅** Future Enhancements**

Add fraud detection triggers for unusual spending.

Integrate admin dashboards for portfolio-level reports.

Enable export to PDF/CSV for customer reports.

Add caching and pagination for large data volumes.

🧭 **Project Outcome**

The Reporting and Dashboard module successfully delivers:
Accurate financial summaries and insights.
A simple, REST-based reporting architecture.
Visualization-ready data for dashboards.
Modular code design for integration with the core banking backend.
